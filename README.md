Data-driven analysis of **3.8M Cyclistic bike trips** (Jan-Aug 2024) to identify behavioral differences between casual riders and annual members, informing targeted conversion strategies to boost annual membership revenue.

## 🎯 Key Findings
- **Trip Duration**: Casual riders take **1.8x longer trips** (22.7 min vs 12.8 min), confirming a leisure/recreational use case.
- **Weekend Usage**: **38.3%** of casual trips occur on weekends (vs 24.4% for members), highlighting a strong recreational pattern.
- **Seasonal Growth**: **13x increase** in casual trips from Jan to Aug, making the summer (Q2-Q3) the prime, high-impact conversion window.

## 🚀 Business Impact & Recommendations
Three actionable strategies are recommended to leverage these leisure-focused patterns:
1.  **Summer Conversion Blitz**: Target the May-August high-growth window with promotions at high-traffic leisure stations.
2.  **Weekend Warrior Membership**: Introduce a lower-commitment, leisure-focused membership tier for the $38.3\%$ weekend user base.
3.  **Location-Based Hubs**: Deploy marketing campaigns at the top 20% of stations that account for $89\%$ of casual rides (e.g., Shedd Aquarium).

## 🛠️ Tools & Technologies
-   **Data Processing & Analysis**: Python (Pandas, NumPy) in Google Colab.
-   **Visualization**: Tableau Public (6 Key Visualizations).
-   **Methodology**: Google's 6-Phase Data Analysis Process (Ask → Prepare → Process → Analyze → Share → Act).

# Cyclistic Bike-Share Capstone Project

## Overview
Analyzed 4.877M Cyclistic bike trips (Jan-Aug 2024) to identify differences between casual riders and annual members, informing strategies to convert casual riders to members.

## Business Question
How do annual members and casual riders use Cyclistic bikes differently?

## Key Findings
- Casual riders: 2.4x longer trips (27.9 min vs 11.6 min).
- 55.6% of casual trips on weekends vs 30.3% for members.
- 6.9x growth in casual trips during summer (Jun-Aug).

## Deliverables
- **Notebooks**:
  - `01_data_processing_cyclistic.ipynb`: Data cleaning and preparation.
  - `02_descriptive_statistics_and_user_behavior.ipynb`: Statistical analysis.
  - `03_visualizations.ipynb`: Visualization generation.
- **Visualizations**: 5 professional charts (executive summary, funnel, timeline, radar, metrics comparison).
- **Presentation**: HTML and PDF formats available.
- **Portfolio**: [https://sites.google.com/view/my-data-porfolio-feltonpierre](https://sites.google.com/view/my-data-porfolio-feltonpierre)

## Tools
- Python, pandas, matplotlib, seaborn, Google Colab

## Impact
Recommended strategies to convert 105Kâ€“210K casual riders to annual members via summer campaigns, weekend memberships, and location-based hubs.
